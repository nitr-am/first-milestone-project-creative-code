# Creative Coding

This project is inspired by a different way of coding. Not the functional and traditional way of coding but one used with creative purposes. This website is to understand what that is, what does it mean, to see some cases of people using creative code and also to learn about some languages that help people develop their ideas. 

Want to learn about it? Have a look. 


## UX
This project is intended to people who have discovered that there is a creative process born of programming. It is for people interested in coding and also in arts or the creative process. It is also for people who have some attraction or curiosity for how does the digital arts are created, at least some of them.

This project is a process to know all the basics about creative coding. What is it, some relevant cases about creative coders, and some languages that allow us to keep learning on the topic. 

For the development of this project I first thought on something really smooth that went from the basics to more advanced concepts. Taking the user from cero knowledge to know the basics, and that is why I decided to make it all in the same page with the only need to scroll down. 

As creative coding is more visual than anything else I give some relevance to videos that show what that is. I also give links to the websites of some relevant coders/artists and for the most relevant languages to produce some relevant work. 

Here is a link to the project I inspired my landing page from, and the second link is another project I did before and from which I took some relevant information like the references below to social network. Links below:

## Features
At the moment the project contains the information and characteristics needed to get a hint of what creative coding is. 

#### Existing Features
- It counts with a short and concrete definition about what coding is. Just what the user needs.
- There is a section called history that states what is known about. As it is something born a few decades ago and is in constant evolution and transformation there is not precise data. In the future as we get more precise information about the topic we will add it.
- There is a section with some programmers who are fully immersed on the topic, there are some video samples that give us a hint of what they do. This is a very important section because it takes us to the best and most talented people in creative coding. This section will have a lot of modifications according to new tendencies, new characters, new and rlevant projects and so forth. 
- Languages section tell us about the current and most relevant languages to creative code. It also has a link to the official sites of each one in order to get more information. 

#### Features Left to Implement
- To the last section (know further) I would like to add some additional links or steps people should follow in order to know more about the topic. I am looking like to acquire some alliance with an institution with courses about it.


## Technologies Used
The technologies used for the development of the project so far are: 
- HTML: to edit the content.
- CSS: to style the content.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): to style and simplify some processes.
- [Cloud9 from Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/es/education/awseducate/): As Integrated Development Environment to integrate all the resources and facilitate the development of the project.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): As online repository. 

## Testing
The project has been tested in different screen sizes, like mobile phone, tablet and desktop size.

It presented a couple of issues at the beginning with the videos because they werenâ€™t responding to changes in size of the screen and also with the languages columns. 

At the end I got a nice, smooth and responsive website.
