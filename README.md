# Creative Coding

This project is inspired by a different way of coding. Not the functional and traditional way of coding but one used with creative purposes. This website is to understand what that is, what does it mean, to see some cases of people using creative code and also to learn about some languages that help people develop their ideas. 

Want to learn about it? Have a look. 


## UX
This project is intended to people who have discovered that there is a creative process born of programming. It is for people interested in coding and also in arts or the creative process. It is also for people who have some attraction or curiosity for how does the digital arts are created, at least some of them.

- As a user I want to know quickly what creative coding is.
- As a user I want I want to see some media examples of what that is.
- As a user I want to see what languages are used in creative coding. 
- As user I want to know about some people working on this so I can go and look for more information about them.
- As a user I want a smooth and logical navigation throughout all the sections.
- As a user I want to know elsewhere to go after visiting the page. 

This project is a process to know all the basics about creative coding. What is it, some relevant cases about creative coders, and some languages that allow us to keep learning on the topic. 

For the development of this project I first thought on something really smooth that went from the basics to more advanced concepts. Taking the user from cero knowledge to know the basics, and that is why I decided to make it all in the same page with the only need to scroll down. 

As creative coding is more visual than anything else I give some relevance to videos that show what that is. I also give links to the websites of some relevant coders/artists and for the most relevant languages to produce some relevant work. 

Here is a link to the project I inspired my landing page from, and the second link is another project I did before and from which I took some relevant information like the references below to social network. Links below:

## Features
At the moment the project contains the information and characteristics needed to get a hint of what creative coding is. 

#### Existing Features
- It counts with a short and concrete definition about what coding is. Just what the user needs.
- There is a section called history that states what is known about. As it is something born a few decades ago and is in constant evolution and transformation there is not precise data. In the future as we get more precise information about the topic we will add it.
- There is a section with some programmers who are fully immersed on the topic, there are some video samples that give us a hint of what they do. This is a very important section because it takes us to the best and most talented people in creative coding. This section will have a lot of modifications according to new tendencies, new characters, new and rlevant projects and so forth. 
- Languages section tell us about the current and most relevant languages to creative code. It also has a link to the official sites of each one in order to get more information. 

#### Features Left to Implement
- To the last section (know further) I would like to add some additional links or steps people should follow in order to know more about the topic. I am looking like to acquire some alliance with an institution with courses about it.


## Technologies Used
The technologies used for the development of the project so far are: 
- HTML: to edit the content.
- CSS: to style the content.
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): To style the website fonts. 
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): to style and simplify some processes.
- [Cloud9 from Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/es/education/awseducate/): As Integrated Development Environment to integrate all the resources and facilitate the development of the project.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): As online repository. 

## Testing

I used W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service to check the validity of the website code.
- [HTML W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
- [CSS W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

#### Client stories testing:

 - A user will immediately what creative coding is.
 - By scrolling down a bit the user will be able to see real life examples of creative coding in a video format.
 - Then the user will notice what languages are used to create what they just saw on the videos. 
 - The user will know about some specific people working on the matter if they want to know further about them.
 - By scrolling down the user will get a hint about the basic concepts on the matter and will be prepared to start their own path of knowledge.
 
#### Testing of functionality on every section.

The project has been tested in different screen sizes, like mobile phone, tablet and desktop size.

- The "What is" section was tested with different background images, some darker others lighter and at the end the current one was selected because it shows what can be achieved with creative code and also let some space to inset some text binding the image and text pretty well. The text was also tested in different forms, inside a square, with an opaque overlay and at the end the white text at the right works well.

- The “history” section was at the beginning pure text with no background and no images and it was looking empty and plane so the solution was to put those cropped images at the bottom. 

- The “some cases” section has been the most problematic section because the videos were not responding to different sizes of the screen. Also the space between the text and the video was problematic because I wanted all the videos aligned horizontally and in order to make it possible I gave some determined height to the text which wasn’t responsive either. Now it is working way better.

- The “languages” section presented similar problems with the buttons below which I wanted to be horizontally aligned at the bottom too. In small screens al the content mixed together 


## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE from [Amazon Web Services](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite), committed to git and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) online repository throughout a built in cloud9 funtion so everybody get access to it.

#### To run this project locally

Clone this project from GitHub following the steps below:

1. Open the following [link](https://github.com/nitr-am/first-project-creative-code) in a new window by pressing right click and then clicking on the "open link in a new tab", that will open my Project GitHub repository.
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download" at the top right.
3. Copy the clone URL for the repository.
4. In your local IDE open your terminal and type: "git clone" , and paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
5. Now you will be able to open the project from your local IDE and see how it works.
